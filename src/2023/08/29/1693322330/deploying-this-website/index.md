This website is a static website, which has been generated by [lupo](https://github.com/davidpeach/lupo).

With it being static html, its hosting requirements are pretty basic:

- Small, inexpensive VPS (I'm using digital ocean)
- nginx
- letsencrypt for ssl

To instantiate a new VPS I will use Terraform; To install the required software on that server I will use Ansible; To deploy this website I will use lupo, which itself uses rsync to send the static html directly from my computer to the server.
