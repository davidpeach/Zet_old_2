title: David Peach's Zettlekasten
---

Welcome to my zettlekasten. This is my personal knowledge base where I put 
pretty much anything I learn and/or want to share publicly.

From code snippets to small programming guides that I want to remember.

You can head to [ the main index here](/index/).

I have a more traditional "blog" at [https://davidpeach.co.uk](https://davidpeach.co.uk), which is powered by WordPress.
